A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.

Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor\\'s  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company\\'s sole option, be reevaluated.\\n\\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor\\'s  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\\n\\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\\n\\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\\n\\n                                    Page -3-\\n\\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.

This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\\n\\n2.

Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor\\'s  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\\n\\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer\\'s  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor\\'s                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor\\'s  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer\\'s  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor\\'s  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor\\'s   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company\\'s   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\\n\\n                                    Page -4-\\n\\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company\\'s  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company\\'s ability to deliver Product.\\n\\n         2.3      Delivery.

The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\\n\\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\\n\\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\\n\\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\\n\\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\\n\\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\\n\\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\\n\\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\\n\\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\\n\\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor\\'s  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\\n\\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year.

Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three.

The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\\n\\n                                    Page -3-\\n\\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\\n\\n2.       PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS\\n\\n         2.1      Orders.  The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor\\'s  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\\n\\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor.
