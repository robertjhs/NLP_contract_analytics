# NLP Contract Analytics
In this project I'm building a machine learning model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify various contract clause types. My goal is that the model can recognize clauses in unseen contracts and categorize them with at least 70% accuracy.



I'm using the [**Atticus Open Contract Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/konradb/atticus-open-contract-dataset-aok-beta) from **kaggle**, which is a hand labelled corpus of legal contracts - courtesy of **atticusprojectai.org**.
